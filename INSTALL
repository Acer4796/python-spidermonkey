Installation instructions for spidermonkey Python / Javascript bridge
module.

1. Download the XULRunner SDK from the following location:

     http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Gecko_SDK

2. Extract the SDK to a directory and set the MOZSDKDIR environment
   variable to point to it, e.g.:

     export MOZSDKDIR=/path/to/sdk

3. Run:

     python setup.py build

   Don't worry about the compiler warnings.  Then, with appropriate
   permissions:

     python setup.py install

To test:

  python test.py

Note that one of the tests currently prints out a JS error message.
This isn't a test failure (though it is a bug).
